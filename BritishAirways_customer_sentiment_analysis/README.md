The interactive dashboard is through powerBI. To navigate to this file search for extension (.pbix). download the file  to access the dashboard.

The pie chart in the dashboard gives the same info as column chart except that it represents the number of reviews in each category as a percentage.

The datasets are downloadable csv files. 

To get the latest datasets please download and run the jupyter notebook in your local machine. Once the notebook is run, the dataset files will be directly available in the notebook file directory to view or download. Please download them to the path of choice.

If you want to see how the latest data reflects the dsshboad visualizations, as the dashboard in the airline_data folder only shows information generated by the notebook uploaded in this current folder.
